== Description ==

Kareem Amer is an Egyptian blogger who is being wrongfully imprisoned and
tortured by the Egyptian government for exercising free speech in blogs, which
criticized certain aspects of corruption in the Muslim clergy and in the
Egyptian government.  A non-profit organization (made up of Muslims, whom are
the very ones Kareem criticized, although they support his right to do so) and
free speech advocates, freekareem.org is working with others to secure his
release.  Several United States senators have also petitioned for his release.  
This plugin was created to provide awareness for the cause.  It allows the
display of a widget promoting the group and creating awareness of the
situation.
