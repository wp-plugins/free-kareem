***All donations for this plugin go directly to the Free Kareem Coalition***

Kareem is a writer who always found the courage within him to keep speaking
his mind freely in the name of not only freedom of speech, but the freedom to
think in an otherwise sheltered society. Because of that, he has been
sentenced to four years in prison.

The Free Kareem Coalition is an interfaith alliance of young bloggers and
college students committed to the principles of freedom of thought and freedom
of speech.

This campaign is our way of fighting to further the cause of brave people who
continue to practice their right to freedom of expression even when such
rights are not recognized. The creators and main supporters of the Free Kareem
Coalition are Muslim, and we are doing this despite what Kareem said about our
religion. Free speech doesn’t mean “speech that you approve of.” It includes
criticism.

You may be disgusted at what he said, even angered. That’s okay, so are we!
But we will defend with all our might his right to express such opinions,
because it is his basic, inalienable human right. We stand by and fully
support Kareem through these difficult times and will continue working on this
campaign until he is freed.

== Description ==

Kareem Amer is an Egyptian blogger who is being wrongfully imprisoned and
tortured by the Egyptian government for exercising free speech in blogs, which
criticized certain aspects of corruption in the Muslim clergy and in the
Egyptian government.  A non-profit organization (made up of Muslims, whom are
the very ones Kareem criticized, although they support his right to do so) and
free speech advocates, freekareem.org is working with others to secure his
release.  Several United States senators have also petitioned for his release.  
This plugin was created to provide awareness for the cause.  It allows the
display of a widget promoting the group and creating awareness of the
situation.
